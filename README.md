# module-9-challenge
In this challenge, I was provided csv files with various tables that I needed to use to create a relational database. I created an ERD to link the pieces of each table together, so that I could answer the data analysis questions.

## Data Modeling and Data Engineering Sections
See schema.sql file for the ERD code with all required tables in proper format.

## Data Analysis
See Data_Analysis_Queries.sql file for the SQL queries created to answer those questions.
